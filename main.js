	Notes: 

	all jQuery $("selector") calls should be in this file,
	*don't* add them elsewhere. this will probably be the only
	file making a new Obj() too. if you're confused please
	ask a GSI - but be sure to read the docs first!!!

	show and hide the spinner when anything is loading.
	only show login or logout buttons - not both
	make sure the clear map function stops the current search
	don't let glitchy UI slide - you'll lose points!
	think in terms of callbacks! it will help you fix async problems

	sometimes jquery and bootstrap dont get along, if .hide() and .show()
	don't work right use: addClass("hide") or removeClass("hide")

	Lastly: We will grade everything on the latest version of Chrome,
	so dev with Chrome for gosh sake! Use the dev tools too they're
	amazing!
